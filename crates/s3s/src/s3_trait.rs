    /// natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and
    /// relationships in text. It automatically detects personally identifiable information (PII)
    /// such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from
    /// documents in your Amazon S3 bucket. </p>
    /// <p>Example 2: PII Redaction - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural
    /// language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and relationships
    /// in text. It automatically redacts personally identifiable information (PII) such as names,
